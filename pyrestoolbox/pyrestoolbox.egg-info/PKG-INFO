A collection of Reservoir Engineering Utilities
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

This set of functions focuses on those that the author uses often while
crafting programming solutions. These are the scripts that are often
copy/pasted from previous work - sometimes slightly modified - resulting
in a trail of slightly different versions over the years. Some attempt
has been made here to make this implementation flexible enough such that
it can be relied on as-is going forward.

Note: Version 2.x now refactors functions into different modules, requiring seperate imports

Includes functions to perform simple calculations including;

-   Inflow for oil and gas
-   PVT Calculations for oil
-   PVT calculation for gas
-   Return critical parameters for typical components
-   Creation of Black Oil Table information
-   Creation of layered permeability distribution consistent with a
    Lorenz heterogeneity factor
-   Extract problem cells information from Intesect (IX) print files
-   Generation of AQUTAB include file influence functions for use in
    ECLIPSE
-   Creation of Corey and LET relative permeability tables in Eclipse
    format
-   Calculation of Methane and CO2 saturated brine properties

Apologies in advance that it is only in oilfield
units with no current plans to add universal multi-unit support.

Changelist in 2.0.0:
- Modified the new Z-Factor method, 'PR', now a tuned five component Peng Robinson method that is fast and stable and able to handle up to 100% of CO2, H2S, N2 or H2 as well as natural gas. Viscosities are calculated with a tuned LBC model.
- Refactored all code to split into modules for ease of future maintenance

Changelist in 1.4.4:
- Added in new Z-Factor method, 'PR', which is a tuned single component Peng Robinson method that is fast and stable 


Changelist in 1.4.2:
- Corrected CO2 solubility calculations when two roots in CO2 liquid phase

Changelist in 1.4.1:
- Added calculation of Ezrokhi coefficients for brine density and viscosity with dissolved CO2

Changelist in 1.4.0:
- Introduced CO2 saturated brine calculations using Spycher & Pruess modified SRK EOS method
- Rectified an error introduced in Gas Z-Factor calculations due to errant indentation

Changelist in 1.3.9:
- Tweaks to speed DAK and Hall & Yarborough Z-Factor calculations

Changelist in 1.3.8:
- Fix bug in Hall & Yarborough Z-Factor calculation

Changelist in 1.3.5:
- Fix bug in ECL deck zip/check recursion

Changelist in 1.3.4:
- Extend ECL deck zip/check function to handle IX formatted decks, and support zipping multiple decks at once.

Changelist in 1.3.2:
- Added robust Rachford Rice solver in Simulation Helpers
- Moved relative permeability functions and simulation helpers to seperate .simtools module

Changelist in 1.2.0
- Added Component Critical Property Library

Changelist in v1.1.4:
- Attempting to fix reported issue with required dependencies not installing correctly

Changelist in v1.1:
- Fix API to SG calculation (141.4 vs 141.5)
- Added lower limit to first rho_po estimate for Oil Density with McCain method to avoid negative values with high Rs
- Added oil_sg and oil_api functions
- Modified HY Z-Factor solve algorithm to improve robustness
- Modified DAK Z-Factor solve algorithm to improve robustness
- Added Gas Z-Factor correlation from Wang, Ye & Wu (2021)
- Removed 'LIN' Z-Factor method due to significant errors above 12,000 psi. Use WYW method instead if speed needed.
